## Jucy Lucy

[Jucy Lucys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jucy_Lucy) practically deserve a whole page of their own.  Invented and perfected in the great city of Minneapolis, molten cheese magma stuffed inside of a ground beef patty never tasted so good.  There are a variety of establishments that serve variations of the Lucy, though [Matt's Bar](http://mattsbar.com/) and the [5-8 Club](http://www.5-8club.com/) both claim to have invited the original.

### Matt's Bar

[Matt's](http://mattsbar.com/) is no-frills kind of place.  Their menu is simple: a Jucy Lucy, or anything you can make with a combination of bread, meat, and cheese: grilled cheese, hamburger, cheeseburger, or fries.  Typically only two people work there, one waitress and the man running the grill, though on a busier night you might be lucky enough to have a third person running the bar.  Don't expect any sort of variations of the Lucy, you can order the original and that's it.  And you better bring cash, because they don't accept plastic.  "Remember, if it is spelled correctly, you are eating a shameless rip-off!"

### 5-8 Club

Not the be confused with [Bar 508](http://www.bar508.com/), the [5-8 Club](http://www.5-8club.com/) serves up the Juicy Lucy with American, Amablu Blue, Petter, or Swiss cheese.  They have three locations scattered around Minnesota.  If you want to try something a little different, you can also order up the Saucy Sally, which claims to be "Lucy's younger sister".  They also have a full menu, so if you're with a crowd you'll probably have an easier time pleasing everyone here rather than with the limited menu at Matt's.
