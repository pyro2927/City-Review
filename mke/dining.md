## Burgers

Nothing accompanies a Miller Lite quite like a fresh burger.  [Food Wars](http://www.milwaukeefood.com/blog/?p=729) have raged across Milwaukee in search of the city's best burger.

### Sobelmans

Many claim that [Sobelmans](http://www.milwaukeesbestburgers.com/) is the true owner of the title "Milwaukee's Best Burgers".  Topped with three kinds of cheese, bacon, chopped onions, and jalape√±os, a Sobelman burger leaves nothing to be desired.  The buns are crisped to perfection, allowing you to grip those meaty patties without worrying about anything sliding out the side.  They don't have the widest selection of beers, though since you're in Wisconsin they almost always have Spotten Cow on tap.  Residing in the valley south of Marquette University, Solbelmans quickly gained popularity amoung Marquette students.  In 2010 they opened up a second location on Marquette's campus, taking over Angelo's old pizza spot.
