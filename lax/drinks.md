## Breweries

### Golden Road Brewing
[Golden Road Brewing](http://goldenroad.la/), near Glendale, is definitely worth a visit even if it's a little out of your way. For anyone who has had the pleasure of visiting [Surly](http://surlybrewing.com/) in Minneapolis, Golden Road reminds me a lot of my beloved and dearly missed Surly. Their beer menu features a variety of IPAs, all which are worth a taste. In fact, they feature four of their IPAs in a flight so you won't have to decide which to try first. On top of a great selection of beers, sure to please any palette, their food offerings are just as good. 

### Santa Monica Brew Works
