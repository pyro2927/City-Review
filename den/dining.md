## Breakfast/Brunch

### Bacon Social House

### Snooze AM Eatery

### Postino*
Though this place does serve a full menu, I've only ever been here for brunch. Their specialty is bruschetta which you can order a flight of 4 different pieces (which are served cut in to quarters). This makes it a great appetizer/sharing dish, but I think it's so good I usually just keep the whole board to myself.

They have a kick-ass happy hour too: $5 mimosas and glasses of wine and $5 pitchers of beer from 11am-5pm, seven days a week.

#### Comida
[Comida](http://www.eatcomida.com/) at the Source is a brick and mortar incarnation of their popular food truck. I've never known this place as a food truck, but these tacos are some of my favorite I've had anywhere. They serve much more than just tacos. Their robust menu includes tortas, griddled tacos, tostadas, gorditas, quesadillas, and the Mexi Mess which is kind of like a burrito bowl. [Full Menu](http://www.eatcomida.com/cantina-menu/)

A taco person at heart, my favorite Comida offering is the Stella's Pork Carnitas which is pork slow cooked in Stella Artois. This melt-in-your-mouth pork sits on a sweet potato mash and is topped with their delicious pineapple habanero salsa.

Speaking of salsa, Comida has 6 salsas ordered in flights of 3. If you have a group of 4 or more, I like to pair these salsa trio with their guacamole. Both come with fresh-made tortilla chips.

Remember that fantastic pineppple habanero salsa? Well, Comida also features a pineapple habanero margarita. The spicy kick with a perfectly salted rim is a great treat on a warm night.

Bonus: Patio seating!

#### Mondo Market (Cheese!)
[Mondo Market](http://www.thesourcedenver.com/mondo) specializes in cheeses, as well pastas, spices, oils, and vinegars. A few of my favorites of theirs include the meat cone (which is exactly what it sounds like - meat and a little cheese rolled in to a cone), any of their deli sandwiches, and the little frozen popsicles in the freezer. 

#### Babette's Bakery
[Babette's](http://www.babettesbakery.com/) serves the most light and flaky pastries I've ever put in my mouth. I love coming here for a breakfast to grab a croissant or danish. Their offerings change daily but there is always something great to try. They also sell fresh baked bread that compares to nothing else. Babette's is a must-go on a Saturday morning.
