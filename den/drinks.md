# Breweries

I actually originally intended for this to be all sorts of venues to find a drink and then realized that I don't really go to bars, so breweries are really the only thing I have any info about. These are all places I've actually been. Obviously there are tons of other options to check out, but I've only included those that I can personally speak to.

### Crooked Stave

### Denver Beer Co.

### Epic

### First Draft
While not technically a brewery, this fine establishment allows you to pour your own beer from a selection of about 40 taps. You get a card to scan at the tap you'd like to pour from and you're charged by the ounce. I really love coming here to try 2-3 oz samplers of lots of different beers. They also have a small (delicious) menu so you can munch on something while you drink.

### Great Divide

### Joyride

### Mockery

### Stem
